## Part 2

In this part, my partner and I  will use the `rvest` package to scrape data from a website, wrangle and analyze the data, and summarize our findings.

1. Choose a website to scrape. Select a website with structured data in HTML tables or well-defined sections.

```{r}
library(rvest)
URL <- "https://worldpopulationreview.com/"
# URL <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population"
w <- read_html(URL)
# class(w)
t <- html_elements(w, "table")
data <- html_table(t)[[1]]


```


```{r}




```
